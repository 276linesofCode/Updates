In the last week
* RGSoC blog post, documenting all of the different types of work done over the summer!
* Revised PR for issue #179 (I2C tutorial) improving explanation of bitshifts
* 3G dongle, some Wifi challenges

Challenges
* Exams are happening
* 3G dongle, ssh'd into Tessel, but were having an issue with the wifi. Unable to download the package onto the Tessel, issue was that the Tessel was not online.
* Thought understood bit shift, but didn't relate to the Kelsey's example slide about bit shifting quite as much as hoped

In the next week
* On the 3G dongle, see if can get help with issues connecting to Wifi
* Having an I2C debug session with Kelsey early next week to go through line by line why the bit shifting works the way it does
* Write a conclusion blog post for This Week in Tessel

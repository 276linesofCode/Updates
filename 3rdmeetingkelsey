In the last week:

* Tried out the Tessel hardware modules. Modules were pretty easy, but GPS made you go outside... command line crashed on servo module, re-installed Node. Modules were pretty straightforward. Went through all the module docs.
* Started playing with PWM as well for LEDs

In the next week:

* Planning to try making a project that does something with a couple of modules. Probably next week.
* Learning a lot, but not able to make a significant technical contribution yet
* Making tests for crash reporter (https://github.com/tessel/t2-crash-reporter/issues/34#issuecomment-315785426) is a good contribution to tackle
* Moving towards implementing 1-Wire. Have call with one of the coaches who is going to help with that today or tomorrow. She's going to have a look at how previous protocols were implemented on Tessel. They will write pseudocode, then implement. Have a hardware module that uses 1-Wire, will try to get it working.

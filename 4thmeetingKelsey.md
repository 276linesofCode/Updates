In the last week...
1. This week, got in touch with coach about 1-Wire implementation plan. Didn't know where to start on getting Tessel to support it.
1. Played around with LEDs + Tessel. As part of college class, had a course using LEDs + Arduino. Wanted to play around with the same exercises on Tessel to get used to Tessel & JS using PWM digital pins– went well, making different patterns, figuring out how to fade etc.
1. Planned 1-day mini-hackathon for in the next couple of days
1. Started some planning for HAP
1. HAP: arm to the elbow, hinged on a vertical board. If you have a table around you, fix arm at elbow joint and try to move it in a vertical direction. Can do 60-90 degree rotation without moving elbow coordinates. Want to make an arm that can be controlled with a camera. Picks up objects, lifts them to a certain height and drops them somewhere else.

Challenges this week
1. Working through 1-Wire, didn't know a good place to start, would like help figuring this out. Kelsey will take a look, possibly recruit help
1. Got stuck for a little bit figuring out which issue to work on. Not sure how to approach. E.g. t2 crash reporter, couldn't make out what functionality to approach. Trying to understand the issue, figure out what to work on. Found a strategy for this with coaches. Thought that this week would be sitting together and working together while reading docs too. Kelsey suggests commenting and asking for more help directly on the issues
1. Tried to use some LEDs but wanted to use Analog Out from lots of pins at once to moderate voltage. Can use resistor instead.
1. PRs with multiple issues addressed– separated them out into different PRs

Plan for the next week
1. Write out a plan for the HAP (Kelsey send PRD template) and send to Kelsey for next week's meeting
1. Tessel-crashbot testing framework for this week
1. Also for this week: three issues selected from Fun With Open Source! February TWIT

Moving forward onto bigger projects
1. Reach repo looks very interesting and is critical path for the Tessel Project. Excited to look into and tackle this!
1. Will take a look at Reach repo and open issues in the next week
1. In the next day, will determine whether ESP-32 can be gotten in India, if not will get one from Kelsey

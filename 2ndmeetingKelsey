Points discussed:

- Worked on official RGSOC blog yesterday
- Just got modules yesterday, will be playing with that starting today
- Have never really sent PRs before, really interesting searching around Tessel and finding all of the issues to tackle
- Started working on quite a lot of PRs
- Happy working on the Tessel blog in the first week, helped get up to speed for the RGSOC blog
- Read a lot on 1-wire and communication protocols
- Read all the documentation on T2's hardware APIâ€“ wanted to understand how Tessel's communication protocols were implemented, took a specific look at SPI to see how the protocol is implemented in code. One of the coaches has been helping, will help review the SPI code line by line
- Read a lot of tutorials for 1-wire and Arduino code for it to get an idea of how it can be implemented. Pretty clear, mostly concerned on how to implement it. Haven't yet figured out all of the implement
- Major work this week will be trying out the different modules, also should be ready to start implementing 1-wire soon
- Work doing from this week on, including using modules, writing code, working on 1-wire will probably have more interfacing with coaches
- Will draft a plan to implement 1-Wire, will need input from Project on how that implementation will work

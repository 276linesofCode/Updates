Last week
* Brihi was sick :(
* Didn't get a lot done on ESP32
* Was working on https://github.com/tessel/t2-docs/pull/167, @HipsterBrown reviewing
* Worked on Fritzing modules
* Looked at t2 restore, but haven't had a chance to actually experiment with it with a Tessel because they weren't in the same place
* Spent the weekend reading up on what a PRD is and how to do it, worked on their own for the humanoid arm project
* Yes, feeling useful! Contributing to open source is a first-time experience, so this expands their knowledge and experience quite a bit. (I asked)

Challenges
* Made modules but couldn't figure out how to export the Fritzing parts to the right filetype. - Kelsey suggests to go ask Fritzing how to do it on their forum
* Challenge installing Google engine for crash reporter. Got it up and running on one computer (Mac) but couldn't get it going on the Windows machine. Will be able to get some work done â€“ Kelsey suggests asking Rahul for help on getting it working on Windows, also suggests pasting terminal output onto Slack to get help faster
* Concept of a PRD is new! Trying to get a handle on it
* It is confusing to figure out where images are supposed to be hosted! Should images be in a folder in the repo, in an AWS link, imgur? Kelsey advises to find someplace stable but not the repo to host, pull in the link
* Having trouble making sure that image link is not broken (like in https://github.com/tessel/t2-docs/pull/165) but local testing isn't working properly. oops didn't know to look in the readme for local deployment instructions, got it now
* Both are a little shy, trying to be less shy to get help faster. Working on it, but it's hard!

In the next week
* Will work just on Reach! This is the most important thing
* Plan on daily updates on how it's going, probably to reach channel on Slack

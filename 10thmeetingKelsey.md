### Been working on
* Working on blog post for Tessel blog, PR in the next week most likely
* Received some PR reviews, more to do!
* Able to communicate with ESP/Reach. Tried to look into some of the things to do on the Reach repo (Issues). Specifically interested in I2C comms for Reach (https://github.com/tessel/reach-wg/issues/18)

### Challenges
* So for Reach issue #18 (I2C/Accelerometer demo), how to connect? Over wires? Need to solder things, will give this a shot

### In the next week
* Finish Tessel blog post
* Complete I2C tutorial revisions, hopefully (finally) merge!
* Work from example of ESP32 I2C implementation (https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples) and try getting it working with the accelerometer
* Kelsey, send logic analyzer! (Kelsey has ~20 logic analyzers from a workshop which project members can use)

### Other notes
* Friends who are trying to get into open source have a problem where people say "it's not mergeable" but don't give a lot of details. Has been helpful to receive very detailed reviews and community response to questions. This is a piece of their feedback to RGSoC, that Tessel does this well
* Technically the program is over, but everything is just now working! Planning to continue, Kelsey continues to be available for calls. Will make calls a "when scheduled" event rather than every week thing, but will basically continue this program.
